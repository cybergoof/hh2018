### The Music

```
Rachmaninoff
From: Alabaster Snowball
Really, it's Mozart. And it should be in the key of D, not E.
```


E D# E D# E E D# E F# G# F# G# A B A# B A# B

Tranposes to:

D C# D C# D D C# D E  F# E  F# G A G# A G# A

That opens up the final room


It seems that Santa was behind the plan the whole time.  It was a test to see how good you are at security

The toy soldiers are elves in disguis.
